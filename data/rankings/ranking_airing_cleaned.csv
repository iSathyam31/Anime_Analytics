To this end, he publicly states his intention to study theology—the academic field held in highest regard in early 15th century Poland. However, an encounter with a mysterious man upends Rafal's life, sparking an illogical desire to instead pursue his passion for astronomy.

Rafal is determined to prove the beauty and rationality of heliocentrism—the theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun.

Those whose beliefs do not align with the will of the Church suffer unfathomably gruesome consequences.

In pursuit of evidence for a heliocentric model of the universe, Rafal grapples with obtaining precise calculations and building empirical theories. His greatest challenge, however, lies in conducting this research discreetly—lest he wish to meet the same fate as other heretics.

However, unbeknownst to them, their battle was recorded and observed by Gomah, an evil being who assumes the title of King in the Demon Realm, filling the void left behind with the death of former ruler Dabura.

At Gomah's side is Degesu, the younger brother of Higashi no Kaioshin, a being who lords over the universe.

The conflict came to an end when mortals' hero, Gram, slayed the Demon Lord Veltol Velvet Velsvolt. In 2099, the world looks a bit different. Alneath and technologically advanced Earth have fused in an event known as Fantasion.

To regain his fame and magical abilities, Veltol follows the advice of Takahashi—Machina's friend and a professional hacker—to start an unusual career: live streaming. His sharp tongue and comically poor gaming skills quickly secure him followers, but to dominate the world once again, Veltol must first uncover Shinjuku's secrets and thwart Marcus' vile plans.
