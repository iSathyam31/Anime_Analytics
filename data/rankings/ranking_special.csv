To restore the reputation of the samurai, the Anti-Foreigner Faction leader Kotarou Katsura resolves to eradicate the Amanto—even if he must resort to violent methods.

Quickly spiraling into a frenzied quarrel, the two groups settle the fight through a game of rock-paper-scissors—albeit with rather brutal methods.

And “Cat Burglar” Nami. They, the Straw Hats, all place a foot upon a barrel and make their vows before their next journey across the great ocean.

At that time, Luffy snatches the Gum-Gum Fruit from a treasure box and eats it and as a result, his entire body becomes rubber and he loses the ability to swim for the rest of his life! A few days later, Luffy is surrounded by the mountain bandits again and Shanks comes to help. “No matter what the reason, anyone who hurts my friends has to pay!!” Shanks and his pirate crew are incredibly strong and they beat down the mountain bandits. Higuma, the head of the mountain bandits, runs away kidnapping Luffy and heads for the sea. However, they encounter a local Sea Monster there and are attacked. Luffy is in a desperate situation... But again, Shanks saves the day. He outstares the Sea Monster and chases it away but in exchange, he loses his left arm... When Shanks leaves the village, he leaves his straw hat with Luffy. “Come bring it back to me someday!

Daicon III Opening Animation
The 1981 Daicon III Opening Animation was solely animated by the three-person studio Daicon Film—consisting of university students Hideaki Anno, Hiroyuki Yamaga, and Takami Akai. While others were involved in the short's production, there were only three members credited. 

Daicon IV Opening Animation
The animation's unauthorized use of the Electric Light Orchestra song ""Twilight"" prevented it from receiving an official release; however, unofficial laserdiscs were produced to pay off the debt of the production. 

The production of the 1983 Daicon IV Opening Animation was said to be rigorous, and its completion was on the day of its premier. Nevertheless, the short's reception was overwhelmingly positive and spawned it a favorable legacy. A 2001 edition of the Animage magazine ranks both shorts at number 35 in its Top 100 anime productions ranking. 

The twelve individuals involved with the production of Daicon IV would go on to found the studio Gainax, responsible for the acclaimed anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion. Brief moments of Daicon IV can be seen in Gainax's anime Otaku no Video, which is based around the formation of the studio.","[{'id': 6, 'name': 'Gainax'}]","{'status': {'watching': '345', 'completed': '17149', 'on_hold': '152', 'dropped': '184', 'plan_to_watch': '4058'}, 'num_list_users': 21888}",76

He learns that it has the ability to kill every person whose name is written inside, provided that the user can visualize the victim's face. Having long deplored the decadence of current society, Light believes this sinister weapon offers him an unexpected opportunity: to eradicate all evil and bring about a new ideal world.

Following a string of fatal heart attacks, the authorities start to suspect that the alarming number of dead criminals is not coincidental. Determined to uncover the mysterious culprit, they join forces with L, an internationally renowned detective. As the death count escalates, Light and L clash in a breathtaking confrontation of wits and deception—a duel that will decide the future of humanity.

Curious, Rikka talks to her friends about the case, who agree that Yuuta is hiding something from her. They decide to discover the contents of the flash drive by any means necessary, but to their surprise, it merely contained pictures of an idol that Yuuta adored back in middle school. However, Rikka takes offense, as she claims that this breaks their contract as lovers and demands Yuuta to return the flash drive.

Although having seen Yuuta return the flash drive, she still felt uncertain about the situation. This leads to her sneaking into Yuuta's room during the night, only to find out that the flash drive had not been returned! Scanning through its contents, she hurriedly rushes to bed when Yuuta enters her room. To her terror, she finds the flash drive crushed due to her negligence in keeping it in a safe place. Yuuta quickly finds out and demands an apology. However, Rikka too, demands an apology from him, resulting in both of them refusing to be the one to apologize first. Will the two lovebirds be able to resolve their argument?

And so, a special unit—the dragon dentists—has the important duty of caring for the dragon's teeth.

Nonoko Kishii was the only one of many brave volunteers who survived a recent round of recruitment; in order to join the dragon dentists, one has to witness their future demise and accept it without a fight.

Despite his appearance being an omen of a great disaster, he is placed under the care of Nonoko as a dentist-in-training. Will Bel come around to the dragon dentists' attitudes toward death and help them face the painful future that is to come?

2. The Far-Away Dawn (Harukanaru Akatsuki)
3. The Rumbling Sky (Meidou no Sora)

Much like the Kidou Senshi Gundam theatrical movies, the Gundam Seed: Special Edition movies are intended to be an override of the story from the TV series.

These episodes are in fact a complete recap of all 50 episodes of the TV series and were first shown on television in Japan. The special edition episodes feature some new scenes and tweaks to previously animated scenes. The first special, The Empty Battlefield, which compiled episodes 1–21 of the series, was aired in two parts on Japanese TV in March 2004, followed by the next special, The Far-Away Dawn, which was episodes 22–40, in July 2004. The final special, The Rumbling Sky, which was episodes 41–50. While the story is overall unchanged, there are a few minor changes. In addition, several scenes are re-animated and re-dubbed.

In an effort to stop his plans, Hajime forces the team to secretly follow the brothers around.

Docchi no Megane Show (Whose Glasses Are These?)
